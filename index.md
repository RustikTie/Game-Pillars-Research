## GAME PILLARS

### What are game pillars?

Game pillars, as the name states, are one of the main support structures of a game. They are the key elements that define the game internally during development. They should be detailed at the beginning of the design process to be able to go back to them any time a new mechanic or feature idea comes up. They are the standard in the industry, predominant in big teams as they help keep everyone on the team on the same page.

It is important to note that they define the game only internally. They can often be confused with unique selling points (USP), as these also define the game, but these do it externally. USP cater to the market, from investors to consumers, and some elements that would be critical as a Game Pillar might halter the progress as a USP. One such example is Accessibility, it is crucial for the team to work around that concept, but when exposing the game to the public you might want to replace that word as the consumer tends  to adhere a bad connotation to it, be it "easy" or "boring". 

More so, they are not a simple list of desired features, they are guidelines upon which the following design decisions should base themselves. They should work as an idea filter and be a great help keeping feature creep away from the project.
